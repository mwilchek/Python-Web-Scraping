NEED TO DEBUG / AVOID REDIRECTS OR MIDDLEWARE

Tutorial resource: https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html

To create a new scrapy project:
1. Make a directory where you want the code to go
2. In a cmd line for that directory type:
- scrapy startproject name_of_project

3. Go back to that directory and under spiders, make a python file for 1 main website to crawl
4. Ensure it has name attribute, start_requests(), and parse()
5. Go back to project directory in the cmd line and type:
- scrapy crawl name_attribute_of_spider

5A. To store data from spider while running type:
- scrapy crawl quotes -o quotes.jl

Note: This will store the data in a json file.

6. Review how you defined the data to be saved

May need to use XPATH instead of CSS to find right IDs:
